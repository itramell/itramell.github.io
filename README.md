## Bible Memorization Application

In January 2024 my work partner Jaylyn Henegar and I created a Bible memorization application for our J-Term class COS 492: Senior Project. Our main goal for the application was to make a fun game for kids to help with memorizing Bible verses, and over the course of 4 weeks we created and documented our application. The languages we used are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and we used GitLab and git in the command line to work together. This application was created to be used for a larger project which would have a backend so that a user may select their Bible verse to memorize. For now, the Bible verse is hard coded to be John 3:16.

The parts that I worked on were the CSS, the majority of the HTML, the documentation on the design of the application, and the linking of all the pieces of the documentation, as it is in three parts. The main part of the documentation is in a README file, which links to the design docs and technical docs. The design docs mainly document the application layout and the CSS and HTML, while the technical docs document the JavaScript.

## Systems Analysis Documentation

In the fall semester of 2023, for my Infomration Systems Analysis class, SYS 390, using a Waterfall method I worked in a group of six to create a systems requirements specification document (SRS) and a business proposal document (BP) to present to our client. Our client was Grace Morton Church located in Illinois, who run Bible quizzing sessions called quiz-offs. They came to us with their problem of having too much human error in the scoring, and having the process of the quiz-offs take too long in delays due to everything being done by hand. We came up with a solution to their problem and proposed our solution to them mid December 2023. From this, we created the SRS and BP documents, which I have included in this repository. 

For the SRS and BP documents, I had the task of creating all the use cases, data flow diagrams and process specifications. I used Google Docs to create the use cases and I used draw.io to create the data flow diagrams and process specifications. The rest of the documentation was split up between the rest of the group.

- [Use Cases](https://github.com/itramell/itramell.github.io/blob/e276f5a8eb8bb5699380099a7185c1bf251b0963/SystemsAnalysisWork/Use%20Cases.pdf)
- [Data Flow Diagrams and Process Specifications](https://github.com/itramell/itramell.github.io/blob/e276f5a8eb8bb5699380099a7185c1bf251b0963/SystemsAnalysisWork/DataFlowDiagrams.pdf)

Note: The SRS and BP are Word Documents, which will need to be downloaded to be viewed. They can be found in the SystemsAnalysisWork folder in the repository, which is the last link in the list above.

## GameJam Game

In Spring of 2023, I, a programmer, worked with Joey Gorski, a programmer, Brickson Cain, an artist, and Ana Ruth Geist, an artist, to create a playable game during Taylor University's CSE department's GameJam. A GameJam is essentially a 3 day competition, where on the first day we are introduced to the theme and get to explore with code. Starting in the evening on day 2, we, from scratch, create a game which then gets presented and judged on the evening of the 3rd and final day, which allocates 24 hours to the actual creation of the game. The theme of the GameJam in the Spring of 2023 was "Color is Everything", and my team and I created a game called Stide&Steek. This game incorporates both cops and robbers and hide and seek, where a cop is looking for the robber in darkness, but as the cop moves he drops colored lights behind him so he can see more. We used the theme "Color is Everything" as the cop cannot catch the robber without light, which in this case is color. Hence, color is everything. The playable game located on itch.io and more information about GameJam itself is linked below:

  - A note on controls: One player uses wsad and the other uses arrow keys. For the cop to catch the robber, the cop must touch the robber player character.

## Kattis Solutions

For my Algorithm Analysis class, COS 320, I have been working on solving problems on Kattis as part of my assignments. I have solved the problems either all by myself or with help from my professor, but all of the code has been written solely by myself. I am only including here problems that I have fully solved. The problems marked with a * at the end are problems I did not get help from my professor with.
