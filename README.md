## Bible Memorization Application

In January 2024 my work partner Jaylyn Henegar and I created a Bible memorization application for our J-Term class COS 492: Senior Project. Our main goal for the application was to make a fun game for kids to help with memorizing Bible verses, and over the course of 4 weeks we created and documented our application. The languages we used are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and we used GitLab and git in the command line to work together.

The parts that I worked on were the CSS, the majority of the HTML, the documentation on the design of the application, and the linking of all the pieces of the documentation, as it is in three parts. The main part of the documentation is in a README file, which links to the design docs and technical docs. The design docs mainly document the application layout and the CSS and HTML, while the technical docs document the JavaScript.
