            <h2>How to Play:</h2>
            <p>
                To play this game, drag the words/phrases from the word bank to the ground to write out the memory verse from beginning to end to build your tower.
                <br><br>
                The game is scored on the number of words placed correctly on the first try and ends once the tower is built. The reveal answer button shows the whole verse; however, use this as a last resort! 
                <br><br>
                Each level (the default is level 2) gets progressively harder by breaking up the verse into smaller pieces and there are 5 additional modes for extra practice.
                <br><br>
                Press play to get started. Best of luck!
